# Introduction to the MODIP Format

The MODIP Format is an open format for Minecraft project metadata. A Minecraft project is a Mod, Resource/Texture Pack, World, Modpack, Modloader/Framework, or other assets related to the Minecraft: Java Edition game.

The Format stores information about projects such as their description, authors, download links, and more.

## Goals

- Create an open standard that can be used by Hosts like Diluv and Modrinth.
- Encourage open discussion and debate about the properties and metadata stored in the format.
- Make Minecraft project distribution open and allow easy interoperability between Hosts.

## Users of the Format

The MODIP format is designed to be used by anyone who works with Minecraft projects. Examples include:

- Hosts, such as Diluv, Modrinth, and CurseForge
- Launchers, such as MultiMC and GDLauncher
- Mod Developers, who can provide metadata about their mods
