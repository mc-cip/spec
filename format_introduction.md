# Introduction to the MCIP Format

The MCIP Format is an open format for Minecraft assets. A Minecraft asset is a Mod, Resource/Texture Pack, World, or Modpack.

## Design goals of the format

The MCIP Format is designed to be:

- **Open** - The Format is an open specification and can be used by anyone without restriction.
- **Modular** - The Format is designed to be modular, so hosts (such as Diluv and Modrinth) can only return data that is needed
- **Expandable** - The Format can be expanded upon to support new properties and data.

## Users of the format

The MCIP format is designed to be used by anyone who works with Minecraft assets. Examples include:

- Hosts, such as Diluv, Modrinth, and CurseForge
- Launchers, such as MultiMC and GDLauncher
- Mod Developers, who can provide metadata about their mods

## Format Documentation

Documentation on the Format specification is provided in **format_spec.md**.
