# Format Values

This document is a list of standardized values that can be used in certain fields in the format.

## Frameworks

The following is a list of standardized Framework names.

- `framework-fabric-loader`
- `framework-forge`
- `framework-liteloader`
- `framework-rift`
- `framework-risugami-modloader`

These names are prefixed with `framework-` to differentiate them between normal Projects. It also prevents possible collisions between Frameworks and other projects that have the same name.

Hosts that serve Framework metadata MUST use these IDs. When a Framework ID is used in metadata, such as listed as a dependency, it MUST be one of the standardized values.

## Tags

This is a list of standardized values that can be present in the `tags` field. It is not required to use these values, although it is encouraged to use them.

- `mod`
- `modpack`
- `resourcepack`
- `texturepack` (note: use `resourcepack` for packs that support it)
- `datapack`
- `world`
- `framework`

## File Relations

Files can have the following `rel` values:

- `primary` - This is the primary file of this version, and what launchers are most likely to use
- `source` - Source code of this version
- `deobf` - Deobfuscation file for this version
- `javadoc` - Downloadable Javadoc
- `installerWin` - This is a generic installer for Windows
- `installerMacos` - This is a generic installer for macOS
- `installerLinux` - This is a generic installer for Linux
- `installerGeneric` - A generic installer
- `versionJson` - Minecraft Version JSON information, used for Frameworks
- `compressedOverrides` - This file is a modpack overrides folder, stored as a compressed file.

Generic Installers exist to allow Frameworks to be stored as Projects. If a Framework offers an installer for both Windows (e.g. .exe) and a generic jar-based installer, they should be stored as separate files with the respective `installerWin` and `installerGeneric` relations.

The `compressedOverrides` relation allows for modpacks to be defined in the format. After downloading all required mods/projects for a modpack, launchers should download the file marked with `compressedOverrides`, decompress it, and copy it's contents to the Minecraft game directory. (TODO: move this information to Installation PR?)

There are also some standard Framework-specific `rel` values:

- `forgeUniversal`
- `forgeMdk`

Non-standardized values may also be used, but they MUST be prefixed with `x-`. If you're using a non-standard value with a Framework, you SHOULD prefix it with `x-frameworkname`.
